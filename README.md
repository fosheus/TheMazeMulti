# The Maze Multi
The Maze Multi is a 2D multiplayer game written in C++ and uses SFML library for rendering and yojimbo library for networking.
Up to 5 players can join a server and the goal is to complete the most maze. It goes from super easy to super hard really fast, so don't loose attention. 
You have to use ZQSD controls to play the game. The host can ask the sever to generate the maze using R key.
It can only be played on a private network for the moment.
