# yojimbo

**yojimbo** is a network library for client/server games with dedicated servers.

It's designed around the networking requirements of competitive multiplayer games like first person shooters. 

As such it provides a time critical networking layer on top of UDP, with a client/server architecture supporting up to 64 players per-dedicated server instance.

## Status

**yojimbo** is production ready.

It provides:

* Cryptographically secure authentication via [connect tokens](https://github.com/networkprotocol/netcode.io/blob/master/STANDARD.md)
* Client/server connection management and timeouts
* Encrypted and signed packets sent over UDP
* Reliable-ordered messages and data blocks
* Packet fragmentation and reassembly
* Estimates of packet loss, latency and bandwidth usage
